# web_log_analytics

This project utilized about one month's log data from a Chinese website that the ultimate goal is let users sign up  their service. Some events include: button clicking, demo watching, page view, courses play, verify cell phone code, form submit, index leave and page close. 

I transformed unstructured log data into structured one for further analysis,
did some exploratory analysis such as find user activity level for different events, define a funnel and analyse churn rate at each stage.

I also identified key factors that bottoleneck the conversion rate.

Eventually I built a machine leanring model to predict user sign up.

One interesting thing I found is that all results pointed to the quality of index page is the key that less users signed up the website.
